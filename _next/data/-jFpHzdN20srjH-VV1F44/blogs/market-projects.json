Tell a *Human* Story First 🗣️\n\n**POC Formula**\n\n| Step | What to share | Example |\n|------|---------------|---------|\n| **Problem** | The pain you felt | “I gained 15 kg while coding all day.” |\n| **Outcome** | The positive win | “Built a calorie tracker, lost 5 kg, hit \\$2 k MRR.” |\n| **Challenge** | The next quest | “Now: can AI help me lose the other 10 kg?” |\n\nWrite the story once → slice it into:\n\n- 280-char tweet  \n- 15 s [Instagram](https://instagram.com)/[TikTok](https://tiktok.com) reel  \n- 1–2 min [YouTube](https://youtube.com) demo  \n- Long-form [IndieHackers](https://indiehackers.com) post  \n- Newsletter blurb  \n\nThe narrative stays; only the container changes.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Launch Stack (Week 0)\n\n| Day | Channel | How-to |\n|-----|---------|--------|\n| **Day 0** | [`Show HN`](https://news.ycombinator.com/show) | One-line pitch + link. Engage fast in comments. |\n| **Day 1** | [`r/SideProject`](https://reddit.com/r/SideProject) | “Feedback welcome” post. Reply to *every* comment. |\n| **Day 2** | [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com) | Schedule (12:01 am PT). Prep maker comment, 3 visuals. |\n| **Day 3** | [Uneed](https://uneed.best), [TinyLaunch](https://tinylaunch.io), [DevHunt](https://devhunt.org) | Same assets, staggered by a few hours. |\n| **Day 4** | Short-form video blast | [Instagram](https://instagram.com) Reels, [TikTok](https://tiktok.com), [YouTube Shorts](https://youtube.com/shorts). CTA → PH page. |\n| **Day 5/6** | [IndieHackers](https://indiehackers.com) “Show & Tell” | Full build/metrics story. |\n\n### Extra directories (20 fast backlinks)\n\nHere are some high-DR startup directories you can submit to (pick ≥10):\n\n- [StartupStash](https://startupstash.com/)\n- [SaaSHub](https://www.saashub.com/)\n- [BetaList](https://betalist.com/)\n- [LaunchingNext](https://www.launchingnext.com/)\n- [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com/)\n- [StartupBuffer](https://startupbuffer.com/)\n- [StartupBase](https://startupbase.io/)\n- [StartupRank](https://www.startuprank.com/)\n- [CrazyAboutStartups](https://www.crazyaboutstartups.com/)\n- [Erlibird](https://erlibird.com/)\n- [KillerStartups](https://www.killerstartups.com/)\n- [SideProjectors](https://www.sideprojectors.com/)\n- [TheStartupPitch](https://thestartuppitch.com/)\n- [StartupBeat](https://startupbeat.com/)\n- [StartupLister](https://startuplister.com/)\n- [StartupInspire](https://www.startupinspire.com/)\n- [Startups-List](https://startups-list.com/)\n- [LaunchLister](https://launchlister.com/)\n- [StartUpRank](https://www.startuprank.com/)\n- [DevHunt](https://devhunt.org/)\n\n(Pick those with good Domain Rating for best SEO impact.)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Two-Hour SEO Sprint (Week 1)\n\n1. [AnswerSocrates](https://answersocrates.com) → dump every question around your seed topic.  \n2. One landing page per question (H1 = exact query, 500–700 words, internal links + CTA).  \n3. [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) → *Request indexing* immediately.  \n4. Pull GSC CSV → sort by *Position* 8-20 → spin out dedicated pages (these are “almost ranking” wins).  \n5. **Reddit keyword boost**  \n   - Grab niche subreddit URL  \n   - Paste into [WordStream Free Keyword Tool](https://www.wordstream.com/keywords) → export 500 terms  \n   - Sprinkle top terms into titles, metas, H2s.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relationship Growth (Week 2+)\n\n### Micro-Influencer Outreach\n\n1. Shortlist creators < 50 k followers in your niche.  \n2. DM: **(Personal hook) + (give product free) + (ask for feedback, not promo).**  \n3. Once they reply, **offer affiliate link or case-study angle** for a natural shout-out.\n\n### Competitor Mentions Hack\n\n- Set **Google Alerts** for rival brands.  \n- When a fresh thread appears, drop value-first comment:\n\n> “Curious—any reason you’re not using **X**? It covers Z + S automatically, so you don’t have to {pain}. Happy to send you a free code.”\n\nNo spam; only join when genuinely relevant.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Maintain & Iterate\n\n| Cadence | Task |\n|---------|------|\n| **Weekly** | Answer 3 fresh questions on [Quora](https://quora.com)/[Reddit](https://reddit.com) using your POC story. |\n| **Bi-weekly** | Update GSC “almost-there” keyword sheet; ship 1–2 new pages. |\n| **Monthly** | Record a metrics recap video (wins + fails). Publish everywhere. |\n| **Quarterly** | Audit directory links—swap low-traffic sites for new alternatives (check threads like [“directory of directories”](https://indiehackers.com) on IH for updates). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |\n\n## 6. Retention & Referral Flywheel\n\n### Post-Signup Drip (Day 0–7)\n1. **Welcome / Quick Win** – help users hit their first “aha” in < 5 minutes.  \n2. **Deeper Use-Case** – short tutorial or template that expands value.  \n3. **Social Proof** – share a customer win + invite reply for feedback.\n\n### Ongoing Loops\n- **In-app NPS (Day 14)** → tag *Promoters* → auto-email a referral link.  \n- **Referral Mechanic** – single-URL powered by Rewardful/LemonSqueezy; give 10 % credit or swag.  \n- **“Share Your Win” Wall** – tiny form feeds a Notion sheet of testimonials you can reuse across PH, X, and newsletters.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Lifetime-Deal Pulse\n\n| Platform | Why use it | Key Tips |\n|----------|------------|----------|\n| **AppSumo** | Massive early reach, reviewer culture | Cap usage clearly; record a crisp Loom demo; respond fast to reviews. |\n| **DealMirror / Dealify** | Dev tools & AI utilities excel | Bundle minor add-ons (icons, template) to stand out. |\n| **PitchGround / StackSocial** | Good for consumer-friendly SaaS | Cross-promo with complementary products for list-swap exposure. |\n\n**Run 2-4 weeks max** and avoid lifetime promises you can’t sustain.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Community Loops\n\n### Targeted Communities\n- **Slack / Discord** – join niche groups *as a human first*. Share a code snippet or insight, then soft-drop your tool.  \n- **Twitter Spaces / X Live** – host a 20-min AMA (“How I built X in 7 days”); invite two micro-influencers as co-hosts.  \n- **Guest Newsletters** – offer a 150-word founder story + exclusive code to curated lists (e.g., TLDR Dev, TheSlice). One aligned send can drive 5–10 k clicks.\n\n*Approach: value → context → ask.* Earn trust before pitching.\n\n\n---\n\n## Living Checklist Template\n\n```txt\n[ ] Story drafted (Problem → Outcome → Challenge)\n[ ] Assets exported (tweet, reel, YT, IH post)\n[ ] Launch week calendar filled\n[ ] 10+ directories submitted\n[ ] AnswerSocrates pages live & indexed\n[ ] GSC almost-there keywords actioned\n[ ] Reddit keyword list merged into site copy\n[ ] 5 micro-influencers contacted\n[ ] Google Alerts set for 3 competitors\n[ ] Metrics recap video recorded\n[ ] Retention drip set up\n[ ] Referral mechanic live\n[ ] Lifetime-deal pulse run\n[ ] Community loops executed\n\n",
